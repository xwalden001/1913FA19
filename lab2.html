   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this laboratory assignment, you will write a Python class called
   <tt>Zillion</tt>. The class <tt>Zillion</tt> implements a decimal
   counter that allows numbers with an effectively infinite number of digits.
   Of course the number of digits isn&rsquo;t really infinite, since it is
   bounded by the amount of memory in your computer, but it can be very large.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Examples.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some examples of how your class <tt>Zillion</tt> must work.
   I&rsquo;ll first create an instance of <tt>Zillion</tt>. The string
   gives the initial value of the counter. Blanks and commas in the string are
   ignored.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>z&nbsp;=&nbsp;Zillion('999&nbsp;999&nbsp;999&nbsp;998')</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   This instance of <tt>Zillion</tt> contains the number nine hundred
   ninety nine billion, nine hundred ninety nine million, nine hundred and
   ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight. This is much larger
   than the maximum number that can be represented in a Java <tt>int</tt>
   variable, which is only 2&nbsp;147&nbsp;483&nbsp;647, or around two billion.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll add 1 to the counter, by calling
   the method <tt>increment</tt>, and I&rsquo;ll print the counter by
   calling the method <tt>toString</tt>. I should see
   <tt>999999999999</tt> (twelve nines) printed.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>z.increment()&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>print(z.toString())</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   I&rsquo;ll add 1 to the counter again, and print its digits as before. I
   should see <tt>1000000000000</tt> (one with twelve zeroes) printed.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>z.increment()&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>print(z.toString())</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Finally, I&rsquo;ll test if the counter contains zero by calling the method
   <tt>isZero</tt>. Of course <tt>z.isZero()</tt> will return
   <tt>False</tt>. But <tt>Zillion('0').isZero()</tt> will
   return <tt>True</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Your class <tt>Zillion</tt> must represent a number internally as a
   list of one or more digits. Each digit <i>d</i> in the list is an
   integer 0&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<i>d</i>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;9. For example,
   the number <tt>1234</tt> must be represented as the list
   <tt>[1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4]</tt>. Although Python provides long
   integers that can have arbitrarily many digits, the class
   <tt>Zillion</tt> must not use these long integers. <i>You will
   receive zero points for this assignment if you use Python&rsquo;s long
   integers in any way!</i>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The method <tt>increment</tt> must work
   like this. Starting at the right end of the list, and moving toward the left
   end, it must change <tt>9</tt>&rsquo;s into <tt>0</tt>&rsquo;s,
   until it finds a digit that is not <tt>9</tt>, or until there are no
   more digits left to be visited. If it stops because it has found a digit
   that is not <tt>9</tt>, then it must add <tt>1</tt> to that digit.
   If it stops because there are no more digits left, then it must add
   <tt>1</tt> to the front of the list. For example, if the list is
   <tt>[1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;9]</tt>, then <tt>increment</tt> will first
   change the <tt>9</tt> at the end of the list to a <tt>0</tt>, then
   add <tt>1</tt> to the digit <tt>2</tt>, resulting in
   <tt>[1,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;0]</tt>. Similarly, if the list is
   <tt>[9,&nbsp;9]</tt>, then <tt>increment</tt> will change both
   <tt>9</tt>&rsquo;s to <tt>0</tt>&rsquo;s, then add <tt>1</tt>
   to the front of the list, resulting in <tt>[1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0]</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hint: unlike the previous lab, you are using
   lists, which are mutable objects whose elements can be changed. In fact, you
   <i>must</i> change list elements, or your program will not work
   correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The class <tt>Zillion</tt> must define the following methods. To
   simplify grading, your methods must use the same names as the ones shown
   here. However, they need not use the same parameter names, except for
   <tt>self</tt>, which must be unchanged. To demonstrate your
   understanding of Python, some methods must be implemented in specific ways,
   as described below.
  </p>
  <dl compact="compact">
   <dt>
    <p>
     <tt>__init__(self, digits)</tt>
    </p>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    <p align="justify">
     The string <tt>digits</tt> must be a string containing nothing but
     digits (<tt>0</tt> through <tt>9</tt>), blanks, and commas. It
     must contain at least one digit. If <tt>digits</tt> contains no
     digits, or if it contains a character that is not a digit, a blank, or a
     comma, then raise a <tt>RuntimeError</tt> exception. Convert
     <tt>digits</tt> to a list of integer digits as described in section
     2, and save it within the instance of <tt>Zillion</tt>. The list
     represents the number that is stored in the counter.
     <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hints: it is not enough to test if
     <tt>digits</tt> is the empty string. For example, a string consisting
     of nothing but blanks and commas, like
     <tt>'&nbsp;,&nbsp;,,'</tt> must raise an exception. Also, you
     may wish to call the built-in function <tt>int</tt>, which converts a
     string to an integer. For example, <tt>int('0')</tt> returns the
     integer <tt>0</tt>.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <p>
     <tt>increment(self)</tt>
    </p>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    <p align="justify">
     Increment the counter, using the algorithm described in part 2. Hint: one
     way to do this is by using a <tt>while</tt> loop, and another way is
     to use recursion. There may be still other ways.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <p>
     <tt>isZero(self)</tt>
    </p>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    <p align="justify">
     Test if the counter contains zero. That is, test if your list of digits
     contains nothing but <tt>0</tt>&rsquo;s.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>
    <p>
     <tt>toString(self)</tt>
    </p>
   </dt>
   <dd>
    <p align="justify">
     Convert the list of digits to a string, and return the string. Hint: you
     may wish to call the built-in function <tt>str</tt>, which converts
     an integer to a string. For example, <tt>str(0)</tt> returns the
     string <tt>'0'</tt>.
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   <b>4. Tests.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="tests2.py">
    <tt>tests2.py</tt>
   </a>
   on Moodle contains a series of tests. The tests create instances of the
   class <tt>Zillion</tt>, call their methods, and print what they return.
   Some of the tests raise exceptions instead of printing values. They show
   whether <tt>Zillion</tt>&rsquo;s methods raise exceptions correctly.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grade your work, the TA&rsquo;s will run
   the tests using your functions. If a test behaves exactly as it should, then
   you will receive all the points for that test. If a test does anything else,
   then you will receive no points for that test. Your score for this
   assignment is the sum of the points you receive for all the tests.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>4. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Run the tests in the file
   <a href="tests2.py">
    <tt>tests2.py</tt>.
   </a>
   Then submit the Python code for your class <tt>Zillion</tt> and the
   results of the tests. Your lab TA will tell you how and where to turn them
   in. Your work must be submitted by <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b>
   on <b>Wednesday, September 25, 2019</b>. (We are experimenting with
   having the same due date for all labs, no matter what day they meet.)
