  <p align="justify">
   We claim to believe that everyone has equal rank. In other cultures,
   however, some people are thought to have higher rank than others. For
   example, the following system of ranks is similar to that used in Nineteenth
   Century Victorian England&#8212;and in some modern fantasy and romance
   novels.

   We can denote each rank by a nonnegative integer, with lower integers
   corresponding to higher ranks. For example, a King has higher rank that a
   Prince, because 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1. Similarly, a Prince has higher rank than
   a Count, because 1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;4. And everyone has higher rank than a
   Commoner, except another Commoner.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the lectures, we used a queue to model a
   line of people waiting to enter a movie theater. As people arrived at the
   theater, they joined the queue at the rear, and left the queue at the front.
   This makes sense where people don&rsquo;t have ranks. If there are ranks,
   however, then things work differently: people arriving at the theater enter
   in order of rank. For example, if a Commoner and a Prince arrive at the
   theater, then the Prince would enter first. And if a King arrives, he would
   enter before either of them. Commoners would enter last of all.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can model the situation just described by
   using a different data structure from an ordinary queue, called a
   <i>priority queue.</i> In a priority queue, objects (perhaps
   representing people) arrive at the rear in the usual way. However, instead
   of leaving at the front, they leave in order of their ranks. Objects with
   higher ranks (and lower numbers) leave before objects with lower ranks (and
   higher numbers).
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Priority queues have other uses besides
   enforcing antiquated dominance hierarchies. For example, a computer
   operating system might work by sharing the central processor among many
   different programs. If some programs are more important than others, then
   the operating system might use a priority queue to decide which program will
   run first.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   We can implement something like a priority queue using a binary search tree
   (<small>BST</small>) that associates a set of <i>keys</i> with a
   set of <i>values.</i> The <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s values are
   objects. Its keys are nonnegative integers that denote the ranks of those
   objects. Unlike the <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s discussed in the
   lectures, the nodes in each left subtree have ranks <i>less than or
   equal</i> to the rank at the root. The nodes in each right subtree have
   ranks <i>greater than</i> the rank at the root. This allows two or more
   nodes to have the same rank.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we enqueue a new object, we use the
   <small>BST</small> addition algorithm discussed in class. If there are
   <i>n</i> nodes in the tree, then the enqueueing algorithm can work in
   <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time, assuming that the objects are
   added in random order of their ranks.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we dequeue an object, we first find a
   node with the minimum key, again using an algorithm discussed in class. We
   then delete this node from the tree. This is easy to do, because it will
   always have at least one empty child, so we don&rsquo;t need a complex
   deletion algorithm that can delete any node. We finally return the object at
   the removed node. The dequeueing algorithm can also work in
   <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <small>BST</small> used to implement
   the priority queue must have a head node, to eliminate special cases when
   enqueueing and dequeueing. It should also use <tt>above</tt> and
   <tt>below</tt> pointers. B<small>ST</small>&rsquo;s with head
   nodes were discussed in the lectures, and code that uses them is available
   on Canvas&#8212;but it is not the same as what you will write here.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, what we&rsquo;ve just described
   isn&rsquo;t really a priority queue! This is because objects of equal rank
   aren&rsquo;t always deleted in the order they are added. To keep the
   assignment simple, we&rsquo;ll ignore that problem: we don&rsquo;t care
   about the order in which objects with equal rank are deleted. All we care
   about is that no object with low rank (like a Commoner) is deleted before an
   object of high rank (like a King).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Write a class called <tt>PriorityQueue</tt> that implements a priority
   queue using a <small>BST</small>. The priority queue must be able to
   hold arbitrary ranked objects of type <tt>Base</tt>, so it looks like
   this.

  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="tests12.java">
    <tt>tests12.java</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains Java source code that performs a series of tests. The
   tests call methods from the <tt>PriorityQueue</tt> class. Some of them
   print what those methods return. Each test is followed by a comment that
   tells how many points it is worth, and what must be printed if it works
   correctly. Turn in your code and the results of the tests in the usual way.
   If you do not know how or where to turn in your work, then please ask your
   lab TA.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your work must be submitted by <b>11:55
   <small>PM</small></b> on <b>Friday, December 6, 2019.</b> This
   due date gives you a little extra time because of the power failure on
   November 25, and also because of the Thanksgiving holiday.
