   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This laboratory assignment is intended as a short introduction to Java for
   students who are already familiar with C or C++. It asks you to rewrite the
   Python class <tt>Zillion</tt> from Lab 2 in Java. Like the Python
   class, the Java class <tt>Zillion</tt> implements a decimal counter.
   However, since you will be using a Java array instead of a Python list, your
   counter will have a fixed maximum number of digits.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Example.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   All the code in this example goes inside the <tt>main</tt> method of
   your driver class. It first creates an instance of <tt>Zillion</tt> in
   the variable <tt>counter</tt>, like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>Zillion&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Zillion(12);</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   The instance of <tt>Zillion</tt> can hold up to twelve decimal digits.
   Its initial value is 000000000000. Note that twelve digits can represent a
   much larger number than will fit in a 32-bit Java <tt>int</tt>, which
   is only 2&nbsp;147&nbsp;483&nbsp;647, or around two billion. The
   <tt>main</tt> method then adds 1 to the counter by calling the method
   <tt>increment</tt>, like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>counter.increment();</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Now the counter contains 000000000001. The <tt>main</tt> method now
   prints the counter like this. Java automatically calls
   <tt>counter</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>toString</tt> method when you try to
   print it.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>System.out.println(counter);</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   You should see <tt>000000000001</tt> printed. If you call
   <tt>increment</tt> again, and then print the counter, then you should
   see <tt>000000000002</tt>. If you call <tt>increment</tt> and
   print the counter one more time, then you should see
   <tt>000000000003</tt>, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Your class <tt>Zillion</tt> must represent the digits of a number using
   a private array of integers (<tt>int</tt>&rsquo;s). Each digit
   <i>d</i> in the array must be an integer
   0&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<i>d</i>&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;9. For example, suppose
   that your array is called <tt>digits</tt>, has a length of 3, and
   represents the number 57. Then <tt>digits[0]</tt> is 0,
   <tt>digits[1]</tt> is 5, and <tt>digits[2]</tt> is 7.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The method <tt>increment</tt> must work
   like this. Starting at the right end of the array, and moving toward the
   left end, it must change 9&rsquo;s into 0&rsquo;s, until it finds a digit
   that is not 9, or until there are no more digits left to be visited. If it
   stops because it has visited a digit that is not 9, then it must add 1 to
   that digit. If it stops because there are no more digits left, then the
   counter has overflowed and it must not do anything else. For example, if
   your counter has three digits, and represents the integer 999, then
   incrementing it must produce 000. It must not indicate an error in any way.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The class <tt>Zillion</tt> must have all the following methods. To
   simplify grading, your methods must use the same names as these. However,
   they need not use the same parameter names.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public Zillion(int size)</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Constructor. Create a private array of <tt>size</tt> integers
      (<tt>int</tt>&rsquo;s). You may assume that <tt>size</tt> is
      greater than or equal to 0. You need not initialize the array, because
      Java initializes all the elements to 0 for you.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public void increment()</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Increment the counter, using the algorithm described in part
      <b>2.</b> One way to do that is by using a <tt>while</tt> loop;
      there may be other ways. If the counter contains all 9&rsquo;s, then you
      must not generate an illegal array index.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public String toString()</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Convert the digits in the counter to a <tt>String</tt>, and return
      that <tt>String</tt>. One way to do that is by using a
      <tt>for</tt> loop that concatenates all the digits of the array
      together using the operator <tt>+</tt>. Java automatically converts
      an integer to a string when you concatenate it to a string.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   <b>4. Tests.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="Driver.java">
    <tt>Driver.java</tt>
   </a>
   contains Java source code for a driver class, unimaginatively called
   <tt>Driver</tt>. This class contains a <tt>main</tt> method, which
   in turn contains code that tests your class <tt>Zillion</tt>. The class
   <tt>Zillion</tt> must <i>not</i> contain the <tt>main</tt>
   method! To grade your work, the TA&rsquo;s will run the <tt>main</tt>
   method in <tt>Driver</tt>. If a test succeeds, then you will receive
   all the points for that test. If a test fails, then you will receive no
   points for that test.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>4. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must turn in Java source code for your class <tt>Zillion</tt>. Your
   lab TA will tell you how and where to turn it in. Your work must be
   submitted by <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b> on <b>Wednesday,
   October 9, 2019</b>.
