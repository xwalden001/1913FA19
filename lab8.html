   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this assignment you will implement a stack as a Java class, using a
   linked list of nodes. Unlike the stack discussed in the lectures, however,
   your stack will be designed to efficiently handle repeated pushes of the
   same element. This shows that there are often many different ways to design
   the same data structure, and that a data structure should be designed for an
   anticipated pattern of use.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The most obvious way to represent a sequence of objects is simply to list
   them, one after the other, like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>c</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>d</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>d</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>d</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>d</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Note that the same objects often appear many times in a row. This is called
   a <i>run</i> of those objects. In the example sequence, there is a run
   of 2 <i>a</i>&rsquo;s, a run of 3 <i>b</i>&rsquo;s, a run of 1
   <i>c</i>, a run of 2 <i>a</i>&rsquo;s, and a run of 4
   <i>d</i>&rsquo;s. You can represent a sequence with runs by listing its
   objects, along with the number of times each object appears. For example,
   you can represent the sequence shown above like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;

       <i>a</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

     <td>
      <p>
       <i>d</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       2
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       3
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       1
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       2
      </p>
     </td>

     </td>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Representing a sequence in this way is called <i>run-length
   encoding.</i> If a sequence has long runs, or many runs, then run-length
   encoding will represent it more efficiently than simply listing its objects.
   However, if a sequence has short runs, or few runs, then run-length encoding
   may represent it <i>less</i> efficiently, because extra space is needed
   to store the lengths of the runs.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since a stack is just a simple kind of
   sequence, you can use run-length encoding to implement it. In this
   assignment, you will write a Java class called <tt>RunnyStack</tt> that
   implements a stack which uses run-length encoding. Here are some examples of
   how it works. Suppose you push an object <i>a</i> on an empty
   <tt>RunnyStack</tt>. Then the stack will look like this, with a run of
   1 <i>a</i>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Now suppose you push <i>b</i>. The stack now looks like this, with a
   run of 1 <i>b</i>, and a run of 1 <i>a.</i>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If you push another <i>b</i> on the <tt>RunnyStack</tt>, then the
   length of the run on top of the stack is incremented, so the stack looks
   like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;2
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If you push yet another <i>b</i>, then the length of the run at the top
   of the stack would increase to 3. However, suppose that you pop the
   <tt>RunnyStack</tt> instead. Then the length of the run at the top is
   decremented, so that the stack looks like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>b</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;1
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   If you pop the <tt>RunnyStack</tt> one more time, then the length of
   the run on top of the stack is decremented to 0. However, a run of 0 objects
   is like no run at all, so it vanishes, and the stack looks as it did after
   the first push.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr valign="top">
     <td>
      <p>
       <i>a</i>&nbsp;1

  <p align="justify">
   Stacks with run-length encoding are used internally by some compilers and
   interpreters, because they often push the same objects over and over again.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must write a class called <tt>RunnyStack</tt> that represents a
   stack. Your class must implement run-length encoding, as described
   previously. It must also hold objects of type <tt>Base</tt>, so it will
   look like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>class&nbsp;RunnyStack&lt;Base&gt;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>{&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8942;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>}</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Your class must define at least the following methods, as described below.
   To simplify grading, your methods must have the same names as the ones shown
   here.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public RunnyStack()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    Constructor. Make a new, empty instance of <tt>RunnyStack</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public int depth()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    Return the depth of the stack: the sum of the lengths of all the runs it
    holds. This is not necessarily the same as the number of runs it holds,
    which is returned by the method <tt>runs</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public boolean isEmpty()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    Test if the stack is empty.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public Base peek()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    If the stack is empty, then throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
    Otherwise, return the <tt>Base</tt> at the top of the stack.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public void pop()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    If the stack is empty, then throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
    Otherwise, decrement the length of the run on top of the stack. If this
    leaves a run of zero <tt>Base</tt>&rsquo;s on top of the stack, then
    remove that run.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public void push(Base base)</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    If the stack is empty, then add a new run of one <tt>Base</tt> at the
    top of the stack. If the stack is not empty, then test if
    <tt>base</tt> is equal to the object in the run at the top of the
    stack. If it is, then increment the length of that run. If it isn&rsquo;t,
    then add a new run of one <tt>base</tt> at the top of the stack. Note
    that <tt>base</tt> may be <tt>null</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    <tt>public int runs()</tt>
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    Return the number of runs in the stack. This is not necessarily the same as
    its depth, which is returned by the method <tt>depth</tt>.
   </p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints, requirements, and warnings. First, all these methods
   must work using <i>O</i>(1) operations, so they are not allowed to use
   loops or recursions. <i>You will receive no points for this assignment if
   you use loops or recursions in any way!</i>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, your <tt>RunnyStack</tt> class
   must have a private nested class called <tt>Run</tt>. You must use
   instances of <tt>Run</tt> to implement your stack. Each instance of
   <tt>Run</tt> represents a run of <tt>Base</tt>&rsquo;s. <i>You
   will receive no points for this assignment if you use arrays in any
   way!</i> The class <tt>Run</tt> must have three private slots that
   have the following names and types. The slot <tt>base</tt> points to
   the <tt>Base</tt> that appears in the run. The slot
   <tt>length</tt> is an <tt>int</tt> that is the length of the run.
   The slot <tt>next</tt> points to the instance of <tt>Run</tt> that
   is immediately below this one on the stack, or to <tt>null</tt>. It
   must also have a private constructor that initializes these slots.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, your <tt>push</tt> method must
   test non-<tt>null Base</tt>&rsquo;s for equality using their
   <tt>equals</tt> methods. It must use the Java
   &lsquo;<tt>==</tt>&rsquo; operator only for testing <tt>null
   Base</tt>&rsquo;s. It is helpful to define an extra private method called
   <tt>isEqual</tt> that takes two <tt>Base</tt>&rsquo;s as
   arguments, and tests if they are equal. If either <tt>Base</tt> is
   <tt>null</tt>, then <tt>isEqual</tt> uses
   &lsquo;<tt>==</tt>&rsquo;. If neither <tt>Base</tt> is
   <tt>null</tt>, then <tt>isEqual</tt> uses <tt>equals</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, <tt>RunnyStack</tt>&rsquo;s
   methods are not allowed to print things. If you were writing
   <tt>RunnyStack</tt> in the Real World, then it might be part of some
   larger program. You don&rsquo;t know if that larger program should print
   things.
