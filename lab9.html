   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Two queue classes were discussed in the lectures. One implemented a queue
   using a linear linked list of nodes. The other implemented a queue using a
   circular array. For this lab assignment, you must implement an iterator for
   the queue class that uses a circular array.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Suppose that we want to visit the elements stored in a sequence, like a
   stack or a queue. Also suppose that we don&rsquo;t want to modify the
   sequence as we visit its elements. Then we can visit them by using an
   <i>iterator.</i> An iterator is class whose instances can visit the
   elements of a sequence. Each iterator has a method called
   <tt>hasNext</tt> that tests if there are more elements to be visited.
   It has a method called <tt>next</tt> that returns the next element to
   be visited, and advances to the following element. It also has a method
   called <tt>remove</tt> that is supposed to remove the element that is
   being visited, but we won&rsquo;t use <tt>remove</tt> here.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can simplify an iterator&rsquo;s design by
   assuming that the sequence won&rsquo;t change while we visit its elements.
   For example, if we use an iterator to visit the elements of a stack, then we
   assume that the stack will not be <tt>push</tt>&rsquo;ed or
   <tt>pop</tt>&rsquo;ped. Similarly, if we use an iterator to visit the
   elements of a queue, then we assume that the queue will not be
   <tt>enqueue</tt>&rsquo;d or <tt>dequeue</tt>&rsquo;d. If a
   sequence changes while an iterator visits its elements, then the actions of
   the iterator become <i>undefined</i>&#8212;which means they don&rsquo;t
   have to work correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   First, you must place the following line at the top of your file.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>import&nbsp;java.util.Iterator;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   This will define the interface <tt>Iterator</tt> as discussed in
   lectures. You must use Java&rsquo;s <tt>Iterator</tt> interface in your
   code. You must not write your own <tt>Iterator</tt> interface.
   <b>I<small>F YOU DO NOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS</small>,
   <small>THEN YOU WILL RECEIVE ZERO POINTS FOR THIS
   ASSIGNMENT</small>.</b>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must then add the following members to
   the class
   <a href="ArrayQueue.java">
    <tt>ArrayQueue,</tt>
   </a>
   whose Java source code is available on Canvas. These members implement an
   iterator for <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. You are not allowed to modify
   <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> except to add these additional members.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>private class ArrayQueueIterator implements
      Iterator&lt;Base&gt;</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This class must be nested inside <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. An instance of
      this class may be used to visit the current elements of an instance of
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. It must have one or more private variables that
      let it &lsquo;&lsquo;know&rsquo;&rsquo; which elements of
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> are to be visited next. You must decide what
      those private variables are.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>private ArrayQueueIterator(</tt>...<tt>)</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This is <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>&rsquo;s constructor. Of course
      it must be inside <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>. It must set the
      <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>&rsquo;s private variables to the values
      of its parameters. You must decide what these parameters are.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public boolean hasNext()</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This method must be inside <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>. It must
      return <tt>true</tt> if there are more elements of
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> that remain to be visited. It must return
      <tt>false</tt> otherwise. This method must use
      <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>&rsquo;s private variables only. Hint:
      use ideas from <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>&rsquo;s method
      <tt>isEmpty</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>

     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This method must be inside <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. It must make a new
      instance of <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt> and return it.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public Base next()</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This method must be inside <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>. It must
      return the next <tt>Base</tt> element to be visited from
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. If no more elements remain to be visited, then
      it must throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>. This method must
      use <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>&rsquo;s private variables only.
      Hint: use ideas from <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>&rsquo;s method
      <tt>dequeue</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public void remove()</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      This method must be inside <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>. However, it
      must do <i>nothing</i>&#8212;it&rsquo;s there only because the
      <tt>Iterator</tt> interface makes us define it. The method
      <tt>remove</tt> is supposed to remove the element currently being
      visited by the <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>, but that doesn&rsquo;t
      make sense for a queue, where elements can be deleted only from the
      front.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Be careful to put these members in the right places. For example, the class
   <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt> must be nested inside the class
   <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>, and the method <tt>next</tt> must5 be inside
   the class <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>, metc. If anything is not in its
   right place, then the iterator will not work.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of
   <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>&rsquo;s methods must work in
   <i>O</i>(1) time. That means you are not allowed to copy
   <tt>bases</tt> from <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> into a similar array
   inside <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>. <b>I<small>F YOU DO NOT MEET
   THIS REQUIREMENT</small>, <small>THEN YOU WILL RECEIVE ZERO POINTS FOR
   THIS ASSIGNMENT</small>.</b>

   <b>3. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="tests9.java">
    <tt>tests9.java</tt>
   </a>
   contains Java code that performs a series of tests. The tests call methods
   from the <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> and <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt>
   classes. Each test is followed by a comment that tells how many points it is
   worth, and what must be printed if it works correctly.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the tests, then turn in the Java source
   code for the modified <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> class, with your
   <tt>ArrayQueueIterator</tt> class in it. If you don&rsquo;t know how to
   turn in your work, then ask your lab TA&rsquo;s. Your work must be submitted
   by <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b> on <b>Wednesday, November 13,
   2019</b>.
