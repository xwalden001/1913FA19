   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This assignment involves implementing a data structure called an
   <i>association list,</i> a term borrowed from the programming language
   <i>Lisp.</i> It acts something like a Python dictionary, because it
   associates keys with their corresponding values. However, it uses a linear
   singly-linked list internally, so it is slower than a dictionary.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   An <i>association list</i> is a linear, singly-linked list of nodes.
   Each node in an association list has three slots, called <tt>key</tt>,
   <tt>value</tt>, and <tt>next</tt>. The <tt>key</tt> and
   <tt>value</tt> slots point to objects of specific types. The
   <tt>next</tt> slot points to the next node in the list (or to
   <tt>null</tt>). The node associates its <tt>key</tt> object with
   its <tt>value</tt> object. Association lists have the following
   operations, all of which involve traversing lists to search for nodes with
   given <tt>key</tt> objects.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    You can get the <tt>value</tt> object from a node. It&rsquo;s the
    object that is associated with the node&rsquo;s <tt>key</tt> object.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    You can change the <tt>value</tt> object in a node. After that, the
    <tt>key</tt> object is associated with a different <tt>value</tt>
    object.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    You can delete the node that contains a <tt>key</tt>. After that, the
    <tt>key</tt> object is not associated with a <tt>value</tt>
    object.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If you cannot find a node, then you can add a new one that contains a
    <tt>key</tt> object and a <tt>value</tt> object. After that, the
    <tt>key</tt> object is associated with the <tt>value</tt> object.
   </p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">
   As a result of these operations, you can use an association list something
   like a dictionary. For example, the <tt>key</tt> objects might be
   <tt>String</tt>&rsquo;s that are English words for numbers. The
   <tt>value</tt> objects might be <tt>Integer</tt>&rsquo;s that
   correspond to those words. If you give the association list an English word,
   then you can get back its corresponding number.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Association lists work by doing linear
   search. As a result, if an association list has <i>n</i> keys, then
   each of the operations described above will require
   <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) comparisons. Later in this course, we&rsquo;ll
   discuss more efficient alternatives to association lists. These will need
   only <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) or even <i>O</i>(1)
   comparisons.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must write a Java class called <tt>AssociationList</tt> that
   implements an association list. To simplify grading, your class must use the
   same names for things that are used here. It must have two class parameters,
   called <tt>Key</tt> and <tt>Value</tt>, so it looks like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>class&nbsp;AssociationList&lt;Key,&nbsp;Value&gt;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>{&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8942;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>}</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Here <tt>Key</tt> is the type of the association list&rsquo;s
   <tt>key</tt> objects, and <tt>Value</tt> is the type of the
   association list&rsquo;s <tt>value</tt> objects.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the class
   <tt>AssociationList</tt>, you must have a <tt>private</tt> class
   called <tt>Node</tt>. The class <tt>Node</tt> must have three
   <tt>private</tt> slots: a slot called <tt>key</tt> whose type is
   <tt>Key</tt>, a slot called <tt>value</tt> whose type is
   <tt>Value</tt>, and a slot called <tt>next</tt> whose type is
   <tt>Node</tt>. It must have a constructor that initializes these three
   slots from its arguments.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try to use the node classes from
   the lectures, or from other lab assignments. They have the wrong number of
   slots, and the wrong types of slots. Also, <i>you are not allowed to use
   arrays in any way.</i> If you implement <tt>AssociationList</tt>
   using one or more arrays, then you will receive zero points for this lab.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your <tt>AssociationList</tt> class must
   also have a <tt>private</tt> variable called <tt>head</tt>. It
   must point to the head <tt>Node</tt> in a linear singly-linked list of
   <tt>Node</tt>&rsquo;s. The head node is a dummy node that is always at
   the front of a linked list; it helps eliminate special cases when deleting
   nodes. Along with <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>head</tt>, your class must
   have these methods. All of them (except for <tt>isEqual</tt>) work with
   <tt>head</tt> somehow.
  </p>
  <blockquote>

      If no <tt>Node</tt> has a <tt>key</tt> slot that equals the
      <tt>key</tt> parameter, then do nothing. Your <tt>delete</tt>
