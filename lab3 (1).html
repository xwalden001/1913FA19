   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This assignment asks you to write a Python function that sorts a tuple of
   integers using the techniques of functional programming. This is the last
   Python lab for this course. We&rsquo;re not done with Python yet: there is
   still a Python project yet to be assigned, there will be questions about
   Python on the first midterm, and one question about Python on the final.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   We say that a sequence of integers is <i>sorted</i> if it has elements
   <i>e</i>&#8320;, <i>e</i>&#8321; ...,
   <i>e</i>&#11388;&#8331;&#8321; in that order, and also
   <i>e</i>&#8320;&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<i>e</i>&#8321;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&#8804;&nbsp;<i>e</i>&#11388;&#8331;&#8321;.
   We can sort such a sequence <i>S</i> using the following algorithm.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    If <i>S</i> has no elements, then it is already sorted, so return
    <i>S</i>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Choose the largest element <i>m</i> from <i>S</i>. If
    <i>m</i> appears more than once in <i>S</i>, then choose any
    appearance of <i>m</i>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Make a new sequence that is like <i>S</i>, except that the first
    appearance of <i>m</i> is removed.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Sort the new sequence by applying this algorithm recursively.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Return the result of adding <i>m</i> to the end of the sorted
    sequence.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   For example, suppose that the algorithm is implemented by the Python
   function <tt>Sort</tt>, which takes a tuple of integers as its
   argument. We can trace the algorithm like this, where <tt>+</tt> is
   Python&rsquo;s concatenation operator, and &#8658; means
   <i>returns</i>.

  <p align="justify">
   The algorithm does not change the values of variables after they are
   assigned, and does not use mutable data structures. As a result, it can be
   implemented using the techniques of functional programming that were
   discussed in the lectures.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must implement the sorting algorithm described in the previous section
   by defining the following Python functions. You must use the same names for
   the functions as are shown here, but you may use different parameter names
   if you like. Throughout, assume that <tt>T</tt> is a tuple of integers.
   The tuple may contain negative integers, zeroes, positive integers, or some
   mixture of these.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>Sort(T)</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Return a new tuple that is like <tt>T</tt>, except that its elements
      are sorted (see above). It works by calling <tt>Maximum</tt> and
      <tt>Remove</tt> somehow.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>Maximum(T)</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Assume that <tt>T</tt> has at least one element. Return the largest
      element from <tt>T</tt>, an integer. Hint: use a
      &lsquo;&lsquo;helper&rsquo;&rsquo; function to do most of the work.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>Remove(T, E)</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Return a new tuple that is like <tt>T</tt>, except that the first
      appearance of its element <tt>E</tt> is removed. If <tt>E</tt>
      does not appear in <tt>T</tt>, then <tt>Remove</tt> must return
      a tuple that is like <tt>T</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Some of these functions may be written easily using higher-order functions
   such as <tt>lambda</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, <tt>map</tt>, and
   <tt>reduce</tt>. However, I won&rsquo;t tell you which ones can be
   written this way, or which higher-order functions you should use. You need
   not use higher-order functions if you don&rsquo;t want to.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these functions <i>must</i> be
   written in a functional, recursive style, and your code must demonstrate
   that you know how to write in such a style. As a result, you will receive
   <b><small>ZERO POINTS</small></b> for this lab if your functions
   do any of the following things.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Use one or more global variables.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Use a loop, such as <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Assign a value to a variable more than once.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Use mutable data structures, such as lists or dictionaries.
   </p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">
   Also, you must not use operators or predefined functions that do things you
   are asked to write yourself&#8212;so you must not call a predefined
   <tt>sort</tt> function from the Python library. If you write additional
   &lsquo;&lsquo;helper&rsquo;&rsquo; functions, then they must not do these
   things either.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Tests.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="tests3.py">
    <tt>tests3.py</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains a series of tests. Each test calls a function from your
   program, then prints what the function returns. Each test also has a comment
   that says what it should print, and how many points it is worth.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grade your work, the TA&rsquo;s will run
   the tests using your functions. If a test prints exactly what it should,
   without error, then you will receive all the points for that test. However,
   if a test does anything else, then you will receive no points for that test.
   Your score for this lab is the sum of points you receive for all the tests.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>4. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Run the tests, then submit the Python code for your functions along with the
   tests. The lab TA&rsquo;s will tell you how and where to turn them in. Your
   work must be submitted by <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b> on
   <b>Wednesday, October 2, 2019.</b>
